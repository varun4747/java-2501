            -> ^ (XOR) - Sets each bit to 1, if only one of the bits is 1
                       - if both values are different then output is 1
                       - if both values are same then output is 0
            -> ~ (NOT) (tilde) - Inverts the bits (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0)
            -> << (Left Shift)
