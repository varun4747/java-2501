            -> JRE is used to RUN JAVA PROGRAMS / APPS

            -> JRE is NOT used to DEVELOP JAVA PROGRAMS / APPS

        -> JDK - Java Development Kit

            -> In Developer Laptops we use JDK

            -> JDK Contains various utilities to Develop & Run Java Programs

    -> W.R.T Hello World Program (App.java)

        -> JDK : You Write Java Code Using JDK Tools (java)

        -> JRE : You Compile Java Code Using JRE (javac)

        -> JVM : Reads .class file i.e Byte Code and Gives it to OS for execution

18th July
=========

    -> Variables

        -> Store the values ?

            -> To retrieve data 
            -> To perform some operations on data
            -> To Store data

        -> brand
        -> description
        -> ratings
        -> price 

        -> Data you want to store, you need to specify data type
            -> above approach is called as Static Typed/Strict Typed

        -> Data Type is classification of data

            -> Primitive Data types 

                -> Fundamental data types, which are prebuilt to store numbers, decimals,
                    characters, symobols, true and false

                        -> byte
                        -> short
                        -> int
                        -> long
                        -> float
                        -> double
                        -> char
                        -> boolean


            -> Non-Primitive Data types

                -> Either we can use already defined by java, Strings, Arrays, Collections, Interfaces etc

                -> As a user you can create your own data types as well
                    Student, Employee, Company etc  
    
    -> NOTE : The local variable someDataNew2 may not have been initialized

    -> We have Instance Variables, Local Variables & Satic Variables 

        -> For any kind of Variables we work with, we need to specify Datatype

    -> Based on the data type we select, default values are applicable
