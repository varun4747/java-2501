Control Structures / Statements
control statements allow you to dictate the order in which statements are executed and enable decisions, loops, and branching. 

There are three main categories of control statements in Java:
Decision-Making Statements (Conditional statements)
Looping Statements (Iteration statements)
Branching Statements (Jump statements)
Types of Conditional Statements in Java
if statement: Runs a block of code if the condition is true.
if-else statement: Runs one block of code if the condition is true, and another block of code if it’s false.
else if ladder: Allows checking multiple conditions in sequence.
switch statement: An alternative to if-else when you have multiple possible conditions for a single variable.






Project Based - LMS - 3 (TASK)
Assessment Task: Tuition Discount Calculation in Java
Task Requirements:
Variables:
Define variables to store:
Student's grade level (1-12)
Base tuition fee 
Discount percentage 
Academic Topper status (e.g., whether the student is an academic topper or not, using a boolean).
Use Conditional statements to determine the discount based on the following rules:
For students in grades 9 to 12:
If they are academic toppers, apply a 20% discount.
Otherwise, apply a 10% discount.
For students in grades 6 to 8, apply a 5% discount.
For grades below 6, apply no discount.
apply additional discounts:
For grade 10, add an additional 3% discount.
For grade 12, add an additional 5% discount.
No additional discounts for other grades.
Calculation:
Calculate the final tuition fee after applying the discount:
discountedFee = tuitionFee - (tuitionFee * discount)
Output:
Print the following information:
Student's grade level
Base tuition fee
Total discount percentage
Tuition fee after the discount


25th July

    -> Looping Statements / Iteration Statements

        -> Loops will help you a block of code to executed repeatedly, based on a condition

        -> Types Of Loops

            -> for loop - when you already know in advance, how many times you need to 
                execute the block of code
            
            -> while loop - runs block of code, as long as the condition is true
            
            -> do-while loop - similar to while, but run the code at least once, 
                even before checking the condition

            -> Branching Statements 

                -> break - exits the loop, when used with for, while, 
                    do-while or switch 

                -> continue - skip the current Iteration 

                -> return - returns a value

30th July
=========

    -> Instance Variables

        -> Declared inside a class, but outside the method and not Static
        -> Belong to each object
        -> Memory is allocated when an object is created
        -> can have default values, if not initialized

    -> Local Variables

        -> Declared inside a method, Constructors or Blocks
        -> Only accessible within method, Constructors or Blocks, in which 
            its's Declared
        -> Must be initialized before use 

    -> Static Variables

        -> Belong to class, not individual Objects
        -> Only one copy exists, meaning shared across all Objects
        -> Accessed using class name 
        -> Initialized Only once, at the time of class loading

-> Constructor - Block of code that performs OBJECT initialization

    -> Constructor is a special method, that initializes newly
        created objects

    -> Method is called, after creating object
        -> Explicitly call method

    -> Constructor is called, at the time of object creation
        -> Implicitly called, while object is being created

    -> Constructors will not have any return type, not even void

    -> method name can be your choice, but Constructor name should
        be class name only    

    -> Default Constructor

        public ConstructorDemo(){

-> Arrays - A data Structure thats holds Multiple Values for 
    a single variable with SAME DATA TYPES, and FIXED SIZE

    -> Types Of Arrays

        -> Single Dimensional Array
        -> Multi Dimensional Array

-> Single Dimensional Array

    -> If we have only a single dimension (only X axis), then its
    a Single Dimensional Array

    -> Each element is Accessed using an Index(Position) 
        (starting from Zero (0) )

        datatype[] arrayName = new datatype[size];

        int[] arrayName = {1,2,3,4,5};


-> Multi Dimensional Array 

    -> If we have multiple dimension (like X axis & Y axis), then its

    -> datatype[][] arrayName = new datatype[size][size];

    // 3D Array
    -> datatype[][][] arrayName = new datatype[size][size][size];
