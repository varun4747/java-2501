            -> ^ (XOR) - Sets each bit to 1, if only one of the bits is 1
                       - if both values are different then output is 1
                       - if both values are same then output is 0
            -> ~ (NOT) (tilde) - Inverts the bits (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0)

Control Structures / Statements
control statements allow you to dictate the order in which statements are executed and enable decisions, loops, and branching. 

There are three main categories of control statements in Java:
Decision-Making Statements (Conditional statements)
Looping Statements (Iteration statements)
Branching Statements (Jump statements)
Types of Conditional Statements in Java
if statement: Runs a block of code if the condition is true.
if-else statement: Runs one block of code if the condition is true, and another block of code if it’s false.
else if ladder: Allows checking multiple conditions in sequence.
switch statement: An alternative to if-else when you have multiple possible conditions for a single variable.






Project Based - LMS - 3 (TASK)
Assessment Task: Tuition Discount Calculation in Java
Task Requirements:
Variables:
Define variables to store:
Student's grade level (1-12)
Base tuition fee 
Discount percentage 
Academic Topper status (e.g., whether the student is an academic topper or not, using a boolean).
Use Conditional statements to determine the discount based on the following rules:
For students in grades 9 to 12:
If they are academic toppers, apply a 20% discount.
Otherwise, apply a 10% discount.
For students in grades 6 to 8, apply a 5% discount.
For grades below 6, apply no discount.
apply additional discounts:
For grade 10, add an additional 3% discount.
For grade 12, add an additional 5% discount.
No additional discounts for other grades.
Calculation:
Calculate the final tuition fee after applying the discount:
discountedFee = tuitionFee - (tuitionFee * discount)
Output:
Print the following information:
Student's grade level
Base tuition fee
Total discount percentage
Tuition fee after the discount
